Quarantine began the 19th of March of 2020 for myself. I did not expect Quarantine would ever begin. I had a lot of doubt. Over quarantine, I remembered that freedom is still a privilege in the world we live on. I will attempt my best to maintain this website updates with daily or weekly summaries of my days.  

April 14th: Yesterday I began watching <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81115994">Tiger King on Netflix</a>. The documentary is rated TV-MA and will be on Netflix for a limited time. I have not finished watching the entire series, but I highly recommend watching it. The documentary begins long ago, mostly about the struggle of animal rights and power over the animal kingdom between two people. I plan to finish writing <a href="https://myquarantine.tk/2020/04/14/create-website/">how to create a website post</a> soon.

Overall summary so far: I enjoyed being home all alone at first. I feel like time is going slower and 2020 is a ticking time bomb. My objective is not to be negative; but, I have great concern over the Yellowstone volcano. Yellowstone is a super volcano which may lead the world into another ice age. On another subject; I've been playing video games like Minecraft with my friends! I enjoy playing with them and we often play very late.
